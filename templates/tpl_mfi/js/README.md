The javascript libraries merging from the Bootstrap template
have several plugins in the directory that are for bootstrap.js
- why aren't they built into the bootstrap bundle? Are there
other plugins that are left out?

dropdown.js
modal.js
popover.js
tooltip.js

Also, has holder.js for an image placeholder library
