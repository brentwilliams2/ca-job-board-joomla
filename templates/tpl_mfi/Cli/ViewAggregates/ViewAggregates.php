  @TODO: implement template view aggregate CLI script

  Idea for this came from trying to decide whether job board comments should have a hit counter
  or not. Comments don't, but it would be useful to implement a Quora or Instagram -like "Your
  content has been viewed n times this past week" periodic email on cron, and to show on user profile pages.

  Entities to count views on might include:

  1. QA Pages / comments / answers, with option to turn it off for authors / editors / employers / recruiters
  2. Job postings
  3. User profile pages
  4. Blog posts
  5. ???
