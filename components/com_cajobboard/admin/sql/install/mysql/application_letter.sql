/*
 * Create content types for Application Letters, mapping fields to the UCM standard fields for history feature
 *
 * type_id:     auto-increment id number.
 *
 * type_title:  descriptive title for this table.
 *
 * type_alias:  <component name>.<type name>. For example: "com_content.article" or "com_content.category".
 *              Used by the com_contenthistory component to find the row for each component in the #__content_types table
 *
 * table:       JSON string that contains the name of the JTable class and other information about the table.
                Gives the com_contenthistory component the information it needs to work with the JTable class for each component.
 * rules:       Not used as of Joomla version 3.2.
 *
 * field_mappings:    Used by the com_tags component to map database columns from the component table to the ucm_content table.
 *
 * router:      Optional location of the component's router, if any.
 *
 * content_history_options:   JSON string used to store information for rendering the pop-up windows in the content history component.
 *                            Structure:
 *
 *    formfile:       This is the path to the XML JForm file for this form. If you add this, the Preview and
 *                    Compare views will look up the labels from this XML file. This way the user will see
 *                    translated labels instead of the database column name.
 *
 *    hideFields:     Some database columns are not meaningful for the user when viewing the item. For example,
 *                    asset_id or check_out_time are not things that appear in the form and are not helpful to
 *                    the user when figuring out the contents of an item. This is entered as an array of column names.
 *
 *    ignoreChanges:  The content history component uses a "hash" calculation (Sha1) to determine whether an item
 *                    has changed. This allows you to see which version in history matches the current version. It
 *                    also prevents duplicate versions from being saved in the content history table (for example,
 *                    if you press the "save" button without making any changes). For this to work properly, we need
 *                    to exclude some columns from the hash calculate. The "ignoreChanges" lets you exclude some database
 *                    columns from the hash so that changes to these columns will not be considered real changes to the
 *                    item. For example, columns such as "hits" or "modified_time" will change with each save, even if
 *                    no meaningful data was changed in the item. This is an array of database column names.
 *
 *    convertToInt:   When the hash value is created, it uses a JSON array of the database column values. In some cases,
 *                    such as start and stop publishing dates, the value might be blank when a row is first created and
 *                    then a different value after the item is saved. To get a consistent hash value for the first and
 *                    subsequent saves, these values can be converted to integers before the hash is created. That way,
 *                    we don't think a value has changed when it really hasn't. This is an array of database column names.
 *
 *    displayLookup:  Here we can define how to display more meaningful data, for example, displaying a category title
 *                    or user name instead of the ID. This is stored as an array of PHP standard class objects. Each
 *                    object has the following fields:
 *
 *        sourceColumn:  The column in the form to replace. For example, the "created_user_id" or "catid".
 *        targetTable:   The database table to get the title or name. For example, "#__users" or "#__categories".
 *        targetColumn:  The column in the target table to use in the SQL query JOIN statement. For example, "id".
 *        displayColumn: The column in the target table to display in the Preview or Compare pop-up window. For example, "name" or "title".
