  Need some way of specifying what a given package gives the buyer. We're using
  Akeeba subscriptions so have its model also. This seems like an ATS-entity,
  attached to a WorkFlow. What if buying outside advertising package? Premium
  ad placement on the multifamilyinsiders site for a job posting? need some
  way of capturing that information.
