This is the Calligraphic Job Board library extension for Joomla!.

The purpose of this extension is to provide a place for library code, both Calligraphic, and third-party, to be maintained. It is designed to have the Composer autoloader included from a plugin on an early system event.

The library extension includes the following third-party libraries:

* Composer
* webonyx/graphql-php
* psr/http-message
* react/promise

Calligraphic libraries are found in the `src` directory.
